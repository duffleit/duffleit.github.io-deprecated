Finally, I got some time to set up my [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog today. It's working with [GitHub Pages and Travis CI](https://github.com/jirutka/rake-jekyll), and through every push at the [blogdata branch](https://github.com/duffleit/duffleit.github.io/tree/blogdata), the blog's source gets updated (on the master branch) and is available via [duffleit.github.io](http://duffleit.github.io/). I like this and [jirutka](https://github.com/jirutka/) did a great job on creating a rake task for [this](https://github.com/jirutka/rake-jekyll).  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i>

In Addition, the [Jekyll Buttler](http://getpoole.com/) provides a solid base to start from and for the nice sidebar I used [SidebarTransitions](http://tympanus.net/Development/SidebarTransitions/).


I will start to collect my thoughts on different topics related to software development here. 
Bye for now, but hopefully, see you soon!

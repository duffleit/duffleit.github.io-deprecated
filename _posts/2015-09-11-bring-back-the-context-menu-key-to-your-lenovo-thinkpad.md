title: Bring back the Context-Menu-Key to your Lenovo Thinkpad
---

Today I received my new Lenovo Thinkpad T450s. I really like it <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i>, but then the absolute shock: There is no **right click** (aka **context menu**) key. Since I use this key very common, I needed a solution, aaand I found a really simple one:

-	Just download a nice small software called **[SharpKeys](http://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/)**. 
-	Start the program and click the **Add** Button. 
-	You can now map the key `Special: PrtSc (E0_37)` on the left side to the key `Special: Application (E0_5D)` *(this is the context menu key action)* on the right side. 
-	Click **Okay** and **Write to Registry**. 
-	**Reboot**, et voil√†, your context menu button is back.

**But how to take a screenshot, without the Print-Key?**. Well, [here](https://getsharex.com/) is the answer. **[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)** is my favorite tool for windows to take screenshots. It's source is available on [Github](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) and allows you to choose any key combination to take screenshots.
